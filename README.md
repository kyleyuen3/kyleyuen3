- 👋 Hi, I’m @kyleyuen3
I’m a Computer Science graduate from San Francisco State University, passionate about AI, software engineering, and building things that actually help people.
I love solving problems, creating clean UI/UX, and working on impactful projects — from machine learning models to full-stack apps to complex algorithms.

I’m currently seeking full-time opportunities in Software Engineering, Machine Learning, or Systems/IT roles, where I can contribute, learn, and continue growing as an engineer.

🤖 Artificial Intelligence & Machine Learning (NLP, DistilBERT, language models)
🧠 Algorithms & Complexity (poly-reductions, Turing machines, automata)
🛠 Full-Stack Development (React, Node.js, MySQL)
🎮 Game Development & Web Projects (Canvas games, interactive sites)
📊 Data Science (feature engineering, statistical modeling, visualization)

- 🌱 I’m currently learning
React and modern front-end development (JSX, components, hooks)
IT and systems fundamentals for entry-level SysAdmin roles
Brushing up on Java, C++, and Python
Organizing and uploading my past university projects to GitHub
